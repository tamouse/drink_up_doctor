Image that are used by the site that are kept small.
Typically things like logos, buttons, accents, and such things.
Large images shouldn't be stored in the git repository,
and they're better out on a CDN.

The `_s3_uploads` directory is ignored by bit, and would
be a great place to store such large items.
