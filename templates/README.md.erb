# <%= name %>

New Jekyll site with Gulp generated by [<%= app_name %>](https://github.com/tamouse/drink_up_doctor).

## Differences from standard `jekyll new`

There is no `css/` folder; all CSS work should be done with SASS/SCSS
in the `_sass/` folder, which is watched by the Gulp 'css' task and
compiled in the `assets/css/` folder.

There is a `main.scss` that is essentially the same as the standard
Jekyll file of the same name, but it has a few extra items described
below.

The path for the site style sheet is changed in `_includes/head.html`
file from `/css/main.css` to `/assets/css/main.css`.

### Normalize

The `normalize.scss` package has been added to the components and
imported by `main.scss`.

### FontAwesome

The `font-awesome.scss` package has been added to the components and
imported by `main.scss`. This lets you use `<i class="fa
fa-github"></i>` and the like. The `svg` entries in the various
standard Jekyll files `header.html` and `footer.html` have been
replaced with these icons.

### baseurl

The `baseurl` is not set in the standard `_config.yml`; instead it is
in it's own configuration file `_baseurl.yml`. Jekyll's `build`
command lets you have multiple configuration files given with the
`--config` option.

## Completing the Installation

After creating the new site, run the following command:

``` bash
./.setup.sh
```

## Working on the Site

After the installation is complete, you can work on the site any time
with the command:

``` bash
gulp serve
```

This will build the site, watch the appropriate folders for changes,
and display the built site in a browser. As you make changes to the
site files, add posts, pages, etc, the site will automatically be
updated and redisplayed in the browser.

You should keep track of the gulp process, though, in case there is a
error during the Compass or Jekyll passes that cause the gulp process
to terminate. Fix them and restart gulp as above.

You can see all the tasks for gulp with the `help` command:

``` bash
gulp help
```


## Distributing the Site

Building your site for distribution, i.e., utilizing the baseurl, is
performed by the command:

``` bash
gulp dist
```

This will put the distribution into the `_dist/` folder in the root of
the site.
